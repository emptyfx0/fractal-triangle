# Sierpiński triangle
The Sierpiński triangle (sometimes spelled Sierpinski), 
also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, 
is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, 
subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, 
this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. 
It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, 
but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.

### Chaos game
If one takes a point and applies each of the transformations dA, dB, and dC to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpinski triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it

1.    Take three points in a plane to form a triangle.

2.    Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position.

3.    Randomly select any one of the three vertex points.

4.    Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.

5.    Plot the current position.

6.    Repeat from step 3.


This method is also called the chaos game, and is an example of an iterated function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). With pencil and paper, a brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.
